**Thoughts** Struggled for codewar question

### Day 2: September 14, 2018
Practiced Java Graph representation using AdjacencyList
https://github.com/Devendra616/DSPractice
Got some issue using github and intellij. 
Before going to bed went through solving some questions on codewar. Read others code and solved one by own.

### Day 3: September 15, 2018
Practiced Java Graph represenation using Adjacency Matrix.
https://github.com/Devendra616/DSPractice
It was quite easy one though has the satisfaction of completion of Graph represenation.
Solved question on codewar for practice. Compared my code with the top codes.

https://www.codewars.com/kata/easy-diagonal/solutions/java?show-solutions=1 (Easy-Diagonal)
my solution : https://github.com/Devendra616/CodewarPractices/blob/master/src/Diagonal.java 
I could pass the first 4 test cases but not the overall time limit for the test cases to run. 

### Day 4: September 16, 2018
Could not get much time for studies because of some meetings and functions. Though coded few questions on codewar.

https://github.com/Devendra616/CodewarPractices/blob/master/src/DirReduction.java
Number of Divisors
https://github.com/Devendra616/CodewarPractices/blob/master/src/FindDivisor.java

## Day 6: September 18, 2018
More on Greedy Algorithms,
